    <h2>Val Thorens, France</h2>
    <p>
      Val Thorens stands as the highest ski resort in Europe, offering
      exceptional snow conditions and access to the enormous 3 Vallées—one of
      the largest interconnected ski areas in the world. The resort sits in a
      bowl-shaped valley surrounded by towering peaks, creating a dramatic
      setting and ensuring long, snow-sure seasons. Skiers can enjoy everything
      from beginner slopes to high-alpine descents, efficient lift systems, and
      seamless connections to nearby Méribel and Courchevel. The village is
      modern, lively, and ski-in/ski-out, making it both convenient and full of
      energy. With its altitude, vast terrain, and vibrant atmosphere, Val
      Thorens is a favorite for skiers seeking both adventure and variety.
